## Introduction
Probability theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and randomness. It plays a crucial role in various fields such as statistics, machine learning, finance, and more. Understanding probability theory is essential for making informed decisions in uncertain situations.

This repository aims to provide solutions to a diverse set of probability theory problems. These problems cover topics such as:

+ Basic probability concepts
+ Conditional probability
+ Random variables
+ Probability distributions
+ Statistical inference
+ And more...

Each solved task is accompanied by explanations, step-by-step solutions, and sometimes code implementations for numerical simulations.

## Usage
